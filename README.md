> Contexts for evaluating R expressions

---

Breaking changes between verisons:

* `package_sources` moves to `provisionr` and changes interface; most of the changes follow from this, so I think we can do a redirect here pretty safely

---

This package organises collecting (and recreating) the context of an R expression to replay later.  At this point, the package is hard-coded to use only filesystem storage, but soon I'll generalise that to allow interfacing with things like `rrqueue` which follow similar ideas.

## Concepts

### Task

A task is an **expression** to be evaluated in a **context**.  When evaluated it will create a **result**.

### Contexts

These are the ingredients to create an environment (in rrqueue they're called environments but I think that context is a little ambiguous).  A context does imply an environment, but several environments might go into a context.

These will be saved at `<path>/contexts/<id>` where `<id>` is an identifier that we'll generate to be unique to a context.

A context includes:

* a set of packages to install and load
* a set of R files to `source`, or a global environment to create
* a local environment to create

In addition, the expression may have local variables.

### Environments

Local and global environments may be saved by the contexts when using `auto=TRUE`.  These will be saved into `<path>/environments/<md5>` where `<md5>` is the md5 sum of the saved file (content addressable).  Note that the global environment is saved as an *image* while the local environment is serialised as a single object.

This may do slightly weird things with complicated interactions between local and global objects and their environments, in which cases users should not use the automatic context generation.  Things like C/C++ pointers, Rcpp/RcppR6 reference objects will also be badly affected.

# Packages

Coordinating package installation on remote machines turns out to be a bit horrible, especially when you only want packages installed if they are not already there (hence all the constructs like `if (!require(pkg)) install.packages(pkg)...` that tend to litter scripts.  This situation is compounded if some packages are to come from non-CRAN repositories (e.g., unstable versions, research code, etc).

To help this, `context` allows specifying a `package_sources` object that can include packages from:

* `drat` repositories
* github (using the devtools `user/repo[/subdir][@ref]` syntax
* bitbucket
* local packages (useful for private reposoitories as there's no need to deal with access rights)

This is done by creating a local, ad-hoc, drat repository that the target machine can use.

There is some overlap here between `context` and tools like [`packrat`](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) and [`rbundler`](https://github.com/opower/rbundler) but the focus here is less on constructing exact versioned environments and more on a lightweight way of bootstrapping an environment and dealing with the possibility of packages from different architectures or R versions coexsting within a common filesystem tree with a minimal amount of reinstalling.

# Generalising

Come up with a general way of specifying all the required bits so that we can reuse this in different contexts; `callr`, `rrqueue`, `experimentr`, `remake` all do variants of this but all store things in different ways.  Something that generalised all of them would be great.  This probably just requires store/retrieve methods for the classed objects that are returned.
