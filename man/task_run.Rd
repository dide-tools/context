\usage{
task_run(handle, install = FALSE, envir = .GlobalEnv, filename = NULL,
  print_error = TRUE, load_context = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{handle}{Task handle}

\item{install}{Install packages when constructing context?}

\item{envir}{Environment to load global variables into.}

\item{filename}{Filename to log \emph{all} output to.  This will
sink the message stream as well as the output stream, so if
specified (i.e., is non-NULL) then this function will apparently
print no output to the console, which will make debugging more
difficult when run interactively.  However, when run
non-interactively, especially on remote servers, this will allow
collection of diagnostics that facilitate debugging.}

\item{print_error}{Print information about an error if one occurs?}

\item{load_context}{Load the context?  This is generally what is
wanted, but if you're repeatedly evaluating expressions in the
same context.}
}
